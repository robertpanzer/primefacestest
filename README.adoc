= PrimeFaces Demo project

This project demonstrates that async OutputPanels don't share the ViewScope with view that contains them.

To run this test, build the project, run the app with the tomee-maven-plugin and go to http://localhost:8080:

----
mvn clean package tomee:run
----

The page shows a property `id` of the `TestController` that is initialized with a random value.

It is shown once synchronously within a normal Panel, and then asynchronously within an OutputPanel.
